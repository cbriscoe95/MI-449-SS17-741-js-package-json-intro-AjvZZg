yarn add --dev stylelint stylelint-config-standard

Could be a problem with the above way that I installed the packages
or with the way I'm writing the path "source/scss/style.scss" since it's installed
locally I shouldn't need to writw an absolute path.

submit to erik and make sure to add a note about stylelint not helping.
